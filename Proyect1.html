<div style="text-align: justify; height: 7178px;"><big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">The
main objective of the project is to make an improvement in the cocoa
fermentation process by adapting the process needs in the fermentation
container.</span><br>
As secondary objectives we can mention:<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">1. Determine the most appropriate procedure in the airification stage</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">2. Determine how airing affects the fermentation time.</span><br>
<br>
I will start by describing the stages of the fermentation process. <br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">HARVEST:</span><br>
The cocoa production cycle is the whole year, presenting two periods of
increased production: from April to June and November to December.<br>
The harvest begins when the ear is mature what happens in a period of 5
to 6 months of age. The cob presents change of pigmentation: from green
to yellow or red and others similar to strong orange or pale yellow. On
cobs of red coloration - very accentuated violaceous, the change of
color may not be very apparent and there is a risk of not harvesting
time the ears that have reached full maturity. Because this difficulty
the ears can ripen and germinate. When doubts exist regarding the state
of maturity of the ear, it is enough hit it with the fingers of the
hand and if a hollow sound occurs It is a sign that it is mature.<br>
</span></big></big></big>

Cocoa ready for harvest</span></big></big></big><br>
</div>
<big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Do not harvest
green or yellowish green cobs or over mature because they affect the
fermentation, producing a high percentage of violet, slate almonds, in
addition they diminish the yield of the grains in weight and in quality.<br>
<span style="color: red;">Harvested ears should not be stored</span> as there is the risk of the almonds germinating inside the ear.<br>
The harvest should be done at regular intervals every two to three
weeks In the presence of a strong incidence of diseases such as <span style="color: red;">Moniliasis and Black Cob</span>, the harvest is done at intervals less than time.<br>
The tools used for the harvest are: scissors pruning, gavilana and
stairs type "A". All cutting tools they must be well sharpened and
disinfected.<br>
The ears to be harvested are cut by the middle part of the peduncle
that joins the fruit to the tree to avoid damaging the floral cushion.<br>
The hawk is used to cut the peduncle by lowering the tool from top to
bottom, never in the opposite direction because it would tear the
floral cushion.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">SHRED:</span><br>
It consists in splitting the cob and extracting the almonds, which Once
separated from the placenta, they will be subjected to fermentation.<br>
The bankruptcy of the ears is done with conditioned tools especially
for this work as short machetes or with pieces of wood to hit and open.
Care must be taken of not damaging the almonds that remain attached to
the placenta.<br>
The separation of the grains is done by hand. The shelling is done
immediately after breaking the cob. The time between shattering and
fermentation<br>
It must not exceed 24 hours.<br>
When the harvest is done, several points are determined within of the
plantation where the ears are piled up, they break, shells and then the
almonds are transported in buckets or bags plastic to the fermenters.<br>

<big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">FERMENTATION:</span><br>
Fermentation is a very important step to have a cocoa high quality, with aroma, flavor and color of chocolate.<br>
Cocoa almonds are fermented in </span></big></big></big><big style="color: red;"><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">special </span></big></big></big><big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: red;">containers</span>, <span style="color: red;">in protected and well-ventilated places</span>, for a period from <span style="color: red;">three to six days</span>, depending on the type of cocoa and the area.<br>
The almonds put to ferment are <span style="color: red;">stirred or overturned each twenty-four</span> hours from one drawer to another or within the same drawer, if the volume allows it, and until the almonds <span style="color: red;">take a brown or chocolate color</span> with incrustations or pronounced streaks.<br>
During rest, the temperature rises and becomes <span style="color: red;">stable in 45 ° C.</span> Poor fermentation causes a violet color or whitish that is observed when splitting the almonds in half.</span></big></big></big><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="file:///C:/WINDOWS/TEMP/moz-screenshot-25.jpg" alt=""><big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><br>
Fermented cocoa seed</span></big></big></big></div>
<big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">During this process, the sugars in <span style="color: red;">the mucilage are fermented and converted to alcohol by the yeasts</span>; then this is transformed <span style="color: red;">in acetic acid (oxidation) by acetic bacteria</span>. Inside of the seed a series of changes <span style="color: red;">such as death of the embryo,</span>
the change of coloration from purple to chocolate, change from bitter
taste to chocolate flavor and separation of cotyledons of the seed.<br>
With the <span style="color: red;">death of the embryo there is a greater permeability of cell walls</span>
and a production of cellular juices. This the enzymes are contacted
with the polyphenols and the proteins, initiating then a process of
hydrolysis.<br>
This process is responsible for the change of the characteristic flavor
of chocolate, transforming the protein into amino acids. In this The
hydrolysis of polyphenols occurs by enzymes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">Box fermentation method:</span><br>
Wooden crates with perforations in the bottom are used to the runoff of
the juices. They can be placed in unevenness (type ladder) to
facilitate turning. The size of the boxes depends of the volume of
production to put to ferment.<br>
</span></big></big></big>

Box to ferment cocoa</span></big></big></big></div>
<big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">Rohan Box Method:</span><br>
It is another simple method, easy to operate, cheap and ideal for small
and medium producers, are made of wood with dimensions of 1.2 m long,
0.8 m wide and 0.12 m deep, one envelope is placed another, in the
amount of ten to fifteen boxes. Almonds are obtained well fermented.<br>
</span></big></big></big>

Rohan Box</span></big></big></big></div>
<big><big><big><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">With this method the cocoa mass is not turned over, t<span style="color: red;">he boxes are they change positions every twenty-four</span> hours and they double purpose of fermentation and drying (for each fermented cassette two are required for drying).<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">DRYING COCOA:</span><br>
It is the process in which the grain loses moisture until take it to
6%, which is left ready for the market and / or for store it.<br>
This process can be done in the sun or artificially.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">Sun dried:</span><br>
It is the most used form and that ensures a good quality of cocoa, what
is achieved between 6 and 8 days of sun. It is done by putting cocoa in
thin layers on a wooden platform or mat bamboo that are materials that
do not transmit flavors or smells strangers. The method of sliding
wooden drawers, with ceiling<br>
Fixed or mobile is the most effective. Its use depends on the capacity economic of the producer.<br>
